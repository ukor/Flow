# Flow Model Context Protocol (MCP) Layer

*   **Manifests:** Define models/tools.
    *   Signed, content-addressed (CID).
    *   Stored within the KG.
    *   Specify:
        *   Interface (inputs, outputs, function signature).
        *   Context needs (required KG data, schemas).
        *   Constraints (UCAN capabilities needed, resource limits, privacy rules).
        *   Proof requirements (e.g., zkDL proof, TEE attestation needed).
*   **Enables:** Verifiable, composable, and explainable use of external functions/models within Flow DAGs and agent reasoning.

## Reasoning & Constraint Solving

*   Integrates symbolic (rules, policies) and statistical (ML models via MCP) reasoning.
*   May utilize an **MCP-Solver** for constraint satisfaction (CSP, SMT) over graph subgraphs defined by context.
*   Reasoning chains link agent SLRPA phases, solver execution, and DAG task execution.
*   Produces verifiable reasoning traces stored in the KG.

## Federated Composition

*   Agents can merge, fork, and snapshot graph partitions using CRDT mechanisms.
*   UCANs control sharing permissions and redaction rules during federation.
*   Supports multi-agent planning and shared contextual understanding.

## Querying

*   Supports query languages like:
    *   GraphQL
    *   SPARQL-lite (subset)
    *   JSONPath / DAGPath
*   Queries operate over local, federated, or historical graph snapshots.
*   Queries are UCAN-gated for access control.
*   Supports privacy-preserving query mechanisms.
*   Allows live subscriptions to graph changes.

## Explainability & Audit

*   Causal chains within the KG link observations, reasoning steps, predictions, and actions.
*   Temporal queries allow reconstruction of agent behavior and decision-making.
*   Verifiable execution traces (signed MCP invocations, proofs) provide auditability.
*   Supports generation of human-readable views of KG data and provenance.

## Compliance & Redaction

*   Policy-driven redaction (omission, masking) based on compliance tags (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
*   Supports reasoning over masked or redacted data where appropriate.
*   Enforces data retention policies defined in the graph or via UCANs.
